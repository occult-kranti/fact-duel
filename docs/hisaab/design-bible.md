# HISAAB DO — Design Bible: "LAL FEETA"

*हिसाब दो — Show us the accounts.* Owner: design lane (roadmap 1.11). Status: decided, September 2026.
Binding inputs: `CHARTER.md` (wins on conflict), the gamification-advisor gates N1–N14, the juice rules,
`lib/progression.mjs`. Working card for engineers: `.claude/skills/hisaab-design/SKILL.md`.
Tokens: `editions/hisaab/theme/tokens.css` (prefix `--h-`, classes `h-*`).

---

## 0. The decisions, in one screen

1. **Identity — LAL FEETA (red tape):** the *sarkari* file reprinted as a pop poster. Tappable things are
   **manila files** with typed file numbers; unopened files wear **red tape**; verdicts are **rubber
   stamps**; evidence is a **receipt**; explanations sit on the green **noting sheet**; your collection
   fills a **tijori**. On top: a **poster layer** of huge Devanagari + Latin type and one hot accent.
2. **One hot accent — SYAHI violet** (`#4a22d4` / night `#9e86ff`): stamp-pad ink, cyclostyle, the voter's
   inked finger; no party's colour. **One violet-filled button per screen = its primary action.**
3. **Fonts** (OFL, verified on npm 25 Sep 2026): display **Akshar**, UI **Mukta** 400/600, typewriter
   **Sometype Mono** 400/700 (real ₹), optional noting hand **Kalam** (lazy).
4. **Objects, not paper:** rounded corners, 2px ink outlines, hard offset shadows, flat colour. No grain,
   hairline grids, serif body or ticker — the rejected looks' signatures.
5. **The label ladder is the core progression.** Ceremonies only for a label promotion and a first-cleared
   state/sector file; everything else updates quietly in place.
6. **Every answer closes with a receipt:** stamp → source → legal status with `asOf` → the other side →
   noting. The receipt is the product.
7. **Notifications:** ≤ 1 toast per screen visit, nothing during a question, no push ever, no streak nags,
   silent until first tap.
8. **Four Rapier set pieces:** TIJORI, TARAZU, THAPPA, FILE PILE — lazy, dpr ≤ 1.5, never in a timed round.
9. **Growth:** WhatsApp-first, server-free — "Forward this — it's actually sourced": receipt cards, a daily
   grid, a certificate per rung, P2P duel links.
10. **Legal art:** no State Emblem/Chakra, no tricolour identity, no party symbols (not even emoji) or
    colours, no media logos, no India outline (tile cartogram), no government-document styling.

## 1. What the owner rejected and what we do instead

| Rejected ("Daily Desk", "Reading Room") | LAL FEETA |
|---|---|
| Cream newsprint / parchment page (`#F7F1E6`, `#F2EAD6`) with page-wide grain | Cool noting-sheet grey-green ground (`#e8ece1`) and flat photocopy-white paper. Grain nowhere. Texture only as small CSS halftone patches on poster moments |
| Zero radius everywhere, 1px hairlines, "cards-in-cards" editorial grid | Chunky objects: 12–16px radii, 2px ink outlines, 4px hard offset shadows; buttons press *down* into the page |
| Serif display (Fraunces, Spectral, Rozha One) + IBM Plex | Condensed sans poster type (Akshar), humanist UI sans (Mukta), typewriter mono (Sometype). Nothing from IBM Plex, no Rozha One |
| Muted brass/leather/editorial red; museum restraint | One saturated violet, plus props (manila, red tape, highlighter yellow, brass) used as objects rather than as page colour |
| Market ticker, masthead, newspaper columns | Poster headline, file covers, stamps, receipts, and a tijori that fills with physics coins |
| Seriousness as the brand | Satire as the brand, with sourcing as the proof. Funny at the top, rigorous in the receipt |

The failure mode is "paper = old": paper objects are **props on a bright, flat, modern stage** — the
page is never parchment.

---

## 2. Identity system

### 2.1 The metaphor map (use these words and objects consistently)

| Game thing | Object | Visual | Copy (EN / Hinglish) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mode, route, state, sector | **File** (फ़ाइल) | manila cover, tab with typed `F.No.` | "Open file" / "File kholo" |
| Unstarted route | **Red tape** (लाल फ़ीता) | red ribbon band on the cover | "Sealed" / "Feeta bandha hai" |
| Starting a route | **Cutting the tape** | tape snaps and falls (endowed progress) | "Tape cut. 1 of 6." |
| Verdict | **Stamp** (ठप्पा) | rotated double-border stamp | SAHI · APPROVED / GALAT · OBJECTION / PENDING |
| Evidence | **Receipt** (रसीद) | thermal slip with zig-zag perforation | "Here's the receipt." / "Yeh rahi raseed." |
| Explanation | **Noting sheet** | pale green sheet with red margin rule | "Noting" |
| Collection | **Tijori** (safe) | glass-front steel safe filling with coins | "Your tijori: 214 receipts" |
| State picker | **Records room almirah** | 30 drawers + the Centre drawer (tile cartogram) | "Records room" |
| Practice bot | **Babu-Bot · BOT** | a clerk that stamps without reading | "Picks at random. Can't see the question." |
| Streak shield | **CL (Casual Leave)** | "CL" chip | "Missed a day. 1 CL used. Streak safe." |
| Duel rank | **Babu rank** (on this device) | LDC → Section Officer → Under Secretary → Joint Secretary → Secretary (Bronze…Diamond) | "Promoted to Under Secretary" (in place) |
| Wild Round | **Surprise Audit** ×2/×3 | brass chip on the between-round card | "Surprise Audit: ×2 XP this round" |
| Confidence calls | **Shayad / Lagta hai / Pakka** | 3-position switch showing points | Steady +2/0 · Bold +3/−1 · Called +4/−3 |
| Achievements | **Stamp Register** | silent entries on Profile | never toasted |

**Why Babu-Bot, not "Neta":** the engine's bot picks at random and cannot see the question
(`planBotAttempt`) — a clerk stamping without reading is exact, funny and honest. A "Neta" opponent makes
every loss "the politician wins", a partisan-feeling frame. TARAZU pans read **JANTA** vs **BABU-BOT**
(or two player names).

### 2.2 The poster layer

- At most **one poster line** per screen (`--h-fs-poster`, Akshar 700): Devanagari above in
  `--h-syahi-text`, Latin caps below in `--h-ink`. Slogans, never data: *जनता का पैसा। / JANTA KA SAWAAL.*
- Optional: a **highlighter swipe** (`--h-marker`) behind one word, once per visit; a riso **overprint**
  (`text-shadow: 3px 3px 0 var(--h-syahi-soft)`) on the Latin line.

### 2.3 Voice

Deadpan sarkari satire aimed at **institutions, labels and blind devotion** — never at the player's
politics, a party's voters, or any religion, caste, region or community. English base; Hinglish lines in
**Latin script** (the English locale never loads Mukta's Devanagari file); Hindi locale UI in Devanagari
(bank stays English until phase 5). Jokes live in empty states, loading lines and one-liners; stems,
receipts and status lines are plain and exact. **Nothing funny happens inside a receipt.**

### 2.4 Legal and political art rules (release gates, charter §2.9)

- No State Emblem, Ashoka Chakra motif, "Satyamev Jayate" lock-up, or tricolour/saffron-white-green
  identity. No "Government of India / भारत सरकार" text, seals or letterhead imitation — the certificate
  says **"Satire. Not a government document."**
- No party symbols in art, icons **or emoji** — banned: lotus 🪷, hand ✋, broom 🧹, bicycle 🚲, elephant 🐘,
  clock ⏰, bow-and-arrow 🏹, lantern 🏮, hammer-and-sickle ☭, rising sun 🌅, kite 🪁, two leaves 🌿. Share grids
  use ✅ ❌ only; when unsure, no emoji.
- No party colours as identity or teams; `govt` is a **neutral text chip** (`Govt then: NDA`) for everyone.
- No media logos, masthead lettering or brand colours; outlet names are set in our mono.
- No India outline — the tile cartogram (§11.3). No photos, caricatures or silhouettes of real people.
- Agency names (CAG, CBI, ED, SEBI, ECI) appear only as a **source-type chip on a receipt sourced to that
  agency**. We never slam a "CBI" stamp on anything — a stamp implies an action (a deliberate refinement
  of the brief's "CAG / CBI stamps").

---

## 3. Colour

### 3.1 Roles (60 / 30 / 10)

- **60% stage** (ground, paper, sheet, receipt) · **30% objects and ink** (manila, ink, ground-2) · **10% signal**
  (`--h-syahi`: primary action, selection, progress, focus).
- **Props** (tape, marker, brass) are metaphor and never carry meaning alone. **Verdicts** (pass APPROVED,
  fail OBJECTION, wait PENDING, noted = syahi) always come with a word and an icon.
- **Legal status** uses **one neutral pair** (`--h-legal`) for every status — ALLEGED is not red, ACQUITTED
  is not green. Colour must never imply guilt (charter §2.2).

### 3.2 Palette (light "Daftar by day" / dark "File room at night")

| token | light | dark | use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--h-ground` | `#e8ece1` | `#121019` | page |
| `--h-ground-2` | `#dce2d2` | `#1c1926` | wells, option tab, skeleton |
| `--h-paper` | `#fbfbf6` | `#221e2d` | cards, options, sheets |
| `--h-sheet` | `#e2efd8` | `#18251e` | noting sheet (explanations, rules) |
| `--h-receipt` | `#ffffff` | `#2a2635` | receipts; certificate (always light when exported) |
| `--h-manila` / `-2` / `-ink` | `#e6c78c` / `#d4ac62` / `#1f1608` | `#3d3223` / `#5c4a2c` / `#f6ebd3` | files |
| `--h-ink` / `-2` / `-3` | `#17131f` / `#45414f` / `#75717f` | `#f3f0e8` / `#bcb7c8` / `#8c8799` | text; `-3` is UI-only |
| `--h-line` | `#17131f` | `#8e88a0` | 2px object outlines |
| `--h-syahi` / `-text` / `-soft` / `-ink` | `#4a22d4` / `#4a22d4` / `#e4ddff` / `#fff` | `#9e86ff` / `#b3a1ff` / `#2b2352` / `#120c2b` | the hot accent |
| `--h-tape` | `#cf2a1f` | `#ff5a4e` | red tape |
| `--h-marker` | `#ffe45c` | `#5e4d00` | highlighter behind ink text |
| `--h-brass` / `-text` | `#d4a12a` / `#7a5700` | `#f2c14e` / `#f5cd6a` | coins, XP |
| `--h-pass` | `#0b7a43` | `#3ed68e` | APPROVED / correct / won |
| `--h-fail` | `#c62a1f` | `#ff6a5c` | OBJECTION / wrong / lost |
| `--h-wait` | `#9a5800` | `#ffb547` | PENDING / timeout (ochre: a file gathering dust) |
| `--h-legal` / `-ink` | `#e4e2ea` / `#2e2a38` | `#2e2a3a` / `#e2deea` | every legal-status chip |
| `--h-slot-a…d` | violet / sky / manila / rose tints | deep tints | answer tab tint (third twin) |

**Why violet:** saffron, green, the tricolour, blue-yellow, BSP blue, red-green, CPI(M) red, BRS pink,
DMK red-black and TMC green-blue are party codes; violet is none of them, and the stamp pad and the
election-ink finger belong to every voter.

### 3.3 Colour-blind safety
Every colour has a non-colour twin: options = letter + shape + tint; verdicts = icon (✓ ✕ ⏳) + word +
pattern (wrong-chosen gets 135° hatching); tiles = fill + glyph; stamps are words.

### 3.4 Contrast report (WCAG 2.x, computed)
A scratch node script parses `tokens.css`, applies the WCAG relative-luminance formula and fails below
the floor: **66 pairs × 2 themes, 0 failures.** Floors: text 4.5:1; UI boundaries/focus 3:1; stamp words
3:1 (large-text floor — stamps are always ≥ 20px bold).

| foreground | on | floor | light (min–max) | dark (min–max) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--h-ink` | ground, ground-2, paper, sheet, manila, receipt, marker, slot-a…d | text 4.5 | 11.23–18.27 | 7.27–16.56 |
| `--h-ink-2` | ground, ground-2, paper, sheet, manila, receipt | text 4.5 | 6.08–9.90 | 6.40–9.65 |
| `--h-ink-3` | paper, ground | UI 3.0 | 3.96–4.57 | 4.68–5.42 |
| `--h-manila-ink` | manila, manila-2 | text 4.5 | 8.39–10.98 | 7.18–10.57 |
| `--h-syahi-text` | paper, ground, manila, sheet, syahi-soft | text 4.5 | 5.23–8.19 | 5.63–8.49 |
| `--h-syahi-ink` | syahi (button label) | text 4.5 | 8.50 | 6.56 |
| `--h-syahi` | ground, paper, manila | UI 3.0 | 5.23–8.19 | 4.35–6.56 |
| `--h-pass-text` / `-ink` | paper, pass-soft / pass | text 4.5 | 5.44–6.37 / 5.41 | 7.77–9.80 / 9.18 |
| `--h-fail-text` / `-ink` | paper, fail-soft / fail | text 4.5 | 5.75–6.93 / 5.60 | 6.76–7.12 / 6.63 |
| `--h-wait-text` / `-ink` | paper, wait-soft / wait | text 4.5 | 6.17–6.96 / 5.57 | 8.87–10.42 / 9.59 |
| `--h-legal-ink` | legal | text 4.5 | 10.88 | 10.52 |
| `--h-brass-text` / `-ink` | paper, ground / brass | text 4.5 | 5.49–6.34 / 7.61 | 10.70–12.41 / 10.41 |
| `--h-tape-ink` | tape | text 4.5 | 5.24 | 6.06 |
| `--h-tape` | manila, paper | UI 3.0 | 3.22–5.05 | 4.06–5.28 |
| `--h-line` | ground, paper, manila, receipt, sheet | UI 3.0 | 11.23–18.27 | 3.68–5.55 |
| `--h-focus` | ground, paper, manila | UI 3.0 | 5.23–8.19 | 5.63–8.49 |
| `--h-pass` / `--h-fail` / `--h-wait` | paper, manila, receipt, sheet (stamps) | large 3.0 | 3.33–5.60 | 4.45–9.25 |

Consequences: `--h-ink-3` never carries words a player must read; stamps on **manila** are ≥ 24px bold
(light-theme stamps on manila measure 3.3–3.4:1).

## 4. Typography

### 4.1 Families (verified 25 Sep 2026 via `npm view` and the Fontsource API; glyphs checked with fontTools)

| role | family | why | coverage / notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Display** | **Akshar** (variable 300–700) | condensed poster grotesque with modern conjuncts (क्त, द्ध) — Teko's stacked ligatures read as "क्क" on phones; 46 KB Devanagari + 20 KB Latin for all weights | ₹ in latin-ext/devanagari; proportional digits — never for counters |
| **UI / body** | **Mukta** 400, 600 | humanist, large x-height, best Hindi UI readability we tested; Latin has `tnum` | use `tabular-nums` for scores |
| **Typewriter** | **Sometype Mono** 400, 700 | typewriter DNA and a real ₹ (Courier Prime has none); 9 KB per weight | **No monospace on Fontsource covers Devanagari (all 62 Devanagari families checked)** — mono slots hold Latin codes, digits and ₹ only; the stack falls back to Mukta |
| Noting hand (optional) | **Kalam** 400 | the babu's marginal note ("Noted. Pl. forward.") | lazy; certificate, share cards, noting sheet; one line per screen |

Rejected: Teko (conjuncts), Anek Devanagari (726 KB Devanagari file for its width axis), Baloo 2 (kids'
ed-tech), Rozha One and IBM Plex (the rejected designs), Google Sans (someone else's brand), Courier Prime (no ₹).

### 4.2 Fonts to install (engine lane runs this; the design lane does not touch `package.json`)

```sh
pnpm add @fontsource-variable/akshar@^5.3.0 @fontsource/mukta@^5.3.0 @fontsource/sometype-mono@^5.3.0 @fontsource/kalam@^5.3.0
```

```ts
// editions/hisaab entry (eager): only these five stylesheets
import '@fontsource-variable/akshar/wght.css'; // family 'Akshar Variable', wght 300–700
import '@fontsource/mukta/400.css';
import '@fontsource/mukta/600.css';
import '@fontsource/sometype-mono/400.css';
import '@fontsource/sometype-mono/700.css';
// lazy, when the certificate / a share card / a noting-hand line first renders:
//   await import('@fontsource/kalam/400.css'); await document.fonts.load("400 18px Kalam");
```

Import the **weight files** (`400.css`), not per-subset files: each declares devanagari → latin-ext → latin,
and overlapping `unicode-range` faces are matched in reverse order, so ₹ (U+20B9) resolves to the small
**latin-ext** file — an English screen never fetches a Devanagari file just to draw ₹. Self-hosted: no
third-party request, works offline.

**Budget (woff2):**

| session | files | total |
|---|---|---|
| English | Akshar latin 20.1 + latin-ext 4.2 + devanagari 46.1 (poster lines) · Mukta latin 20.0 + 20.7 · Sometype latin 9.5 + 9.4 + latin-ext 6.6 + 6.5 · (Mukta latin-ext 14.3 + 14.6 only if ₹ appears in UI text) | **≈ 143 KB** (≈ 172 KB) |
| Hindi | English set + Mukta devanagari 97.0 + 100.2 | **≈ 370 KB** |
| Kalam (lazy) | latin 21.8 + latin-ext 11.9 (+ devanagari 106.8 in Hindi) | 34 KB (141 KB) |

Preload only `akshar-latin-wght` and `mukta-latin-400`; `font-display: swap` everywhere; fallback stacks in `tokens.css`.

### 4.3 Scale and use

| token | px | family / weight | use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--h-fs-poster` | clamp 44–96 | display 700 caps | the one poster line |
| `--h-fs-5xl` | 64 | display 700 | certificate label, verdict word (desktop) |
| `--h-fs-4xl` | 48 | display 700 | verdict word (phone), label on Profile |
| `--h-fs-3xl` | 38 | display 700 | screen title |
| `--h-fs-2xl` | 30 | display 700 | file title, label on cards |
| `--h-fs-xl` | 24 | display 600 | card titles, stamp words |
| `--h-fs-stem` | clamp 20–26 | UI 600 | question stem |
| `--h-fs-m` / `-l` | 18 / 20 | UI 400/600 | options, lead |
| `--h-fs-s` | 16 | UI 400 | body, inputs (iOS zoom floor) |
| `--h-fs-xs` | 14 | UI 400 / mono 400 | meta, receipt lines; **floor for any sentence** |
| `--h-fs-2xs` | 12 | mono caps / UI 600 | kickers, tab labels, chips only (never a sentence) |

Latin display is always uppercase (`--h-lh-caps: .95`). Any display line containing Devanagari uses
`--h-lh-display-deva: 1.25`. Numbers that change (score, XP, timer) use Sometype Mono or Mukta with `tnum`.

### 4.4 Devanagari rules
1. **Never letter-space Devanagari** (it breaks the shirorekha): tracking only on Latin/`:lang(en)`;
   `letter-spacing: 0` on `:lang(hi)`.
2. No Devanagari in the mono face — mono is for codes (`F.No. S/UP/06`), digits and ₹.
3. Line height ≥ 1.25 display / 1.6 body (`:root[lang='hi']` swaps tokens). Don't set `line-height` on
   strings that wrap in Hindi; never `overflow: hidden` a text-tight box (matras clip).
4. Devanagari spans inside English screens get `lang="hi"`.
5. Latin digits in both locales, grouped `Intl.NumberFormat('en-IN')`; lakh/crore in both (`₹1.2 lakh
   crore` / `₹1.2 लाख करोड़`); `asOf` renders "as of Sep 2026".
6. Correct nukta and chandrabindu (फ़ाइल, माँगो); a Hindi reader reviews strings before release.
7. `word-break: normal`; `overflow-wrap: anywhere` only on URLs and codes. Budget ~30% more width for
   Hindi; buttons wrap to two lines, never truncate.

### 4.5 The nine labels (display set, Devanagari over Latin)

| band | Devanagari | Latin | one-liner (EN) | Hinglish line |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | अंधभक्त | ANDHBHAKT | Forwards first. Reads never. | "Forward pehle, padhna kabhi nahi." |
| 1 | व्हाट्सऐप यूनिवर्सिटी फ़्रेशर | WHATSAPP UNIVERSITY FRESHER | Enrolled. Attendance: every group. | "Admission ho gaya. Har group mein hazri." |
| 2 | प्राइम-टाइम लॉयलिस्ट | PRIME-TIME LOYALIST | Knows the anchor's voice better than the budget. | "Anchor ki awaaz yaad, budget nahi." |
| 3 | न्यूट्रल अंकल | NEUTRAL UNCLE | "Sab chor hain." Has not checked which ones. | "Sab chor hain — kaun, yeh check nahi kiya." |
| 4 | रसीद माँगो | RECEIPT MAANGO | Has started asking for the bill. | "Ab bill maangne lage ho." |
| 5 | आरटीआई योद्धा | RTI WARRIOR | Files questions. Waits 30 days. | "Sawaal file karo. 30 din ruko." |
| 6 | अर्बन नक्सल | URBAN NAXAL *(as per the forwards)* | Reads CAG reports on the metro. | "Metro mein CAG report padhta hai." |
| 7 | टुकड़े-टुकड़े गैंग | TUKDE-TUKDE GANG | Counts crores in tukdas. | "Crore ko tukdon mein ginta hai." |
| 8 | सर्टिफ़ाइड एंटी-नेशनल | CERTIFIED ANTI-NATIONAL | Knows where the money went. Asks anyway. | "Paisa kahan gaya, pata hai. Phir bhi poochta hai." |

A label always appears with its one-liner. The first Andhbhakt sighting adds **"Everyone starts here —
of anyone, for anything. Receipts get you out."**, keeping the rung about reading habits, not party.

## 5. Shape, surface and components (`h-*`)

**Global:** radii `--h-r-m` 12 (controls), `--h-r-l` 16 (files/cards), `--h-r-xl` 24 (sheets/ceremony);
outlines `--h-bw` 2px `--h-line`; shadows are hard (`--h-shadow-2` = 4px 4px 0). Blur shadows
(`--h-shadow-float`) and `backdrop-filter` are allowed only on overlays. Mobile first; breakpoints 600 / 900
(bottom bar ↔ rail) / 1200. `100dvh`, never bare `vh`. Gutters 16px. No horizontal scroll.

| component | anatomy | states | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`h-btn`** | 52px min height, 2px outline, `--h-r-m`, `--h-shadow-2`; label UI 600 18px, trailing → | `--primary` (syahi fill, **one per screen**), `--paper`, `--ghost` (text + underline), disabled (`--h-ink-3`, no shadow) | **Press = print down:** on `pointerdown` translate(2px,2px) and shadow → `--h-shadow-0` over `--h-dur-tap`; never delays the click |
| **`h-file`** | manila cover, top-left tab (mono `F.No.`), title display 30px, meta UI 14px, optional meter, optional tape | `sealed` (tape band), `open` (meter), `cleared` (✓ CLEARED stamp in corner, syahi tab), `pressed` (manila-2) | the tappable unit for modes, routes and states; a whole-card link with ≥ 44px targets inside |
| **`h-tape`** | 12px red band across the lower third (cards) or bottom edge (tiles), never over text | idle / snapping (two halves rotate ±12° and fall, `--h-ease-tape`) | snapping plays once, on the first card of a route |
| **`h-opt`** (answer) | 60px min, paper, 2px outline, `--h-r-m`; left tab 52px holding letter (A/क) over shape glyph (▲◆●■) on `--h-slot-*`; label UI 18px | `idle`, `pressed`, `locked` (3px syahi ring + 🔒 "Locked"), `correct` (3px pass outline, tab pass-filled with ✓ + shape), `wrong-chosen` (tab fail-filled ✕ + shape, body hatched `--h-fail-soft`), `correct-unchosen` (dashed pass outline + ✓), `other` (opacity .55) | fixed order; `touch-action: manipulation`; `user-select: none`; keys 1–4 / A–D |
| **`h-stamp`** | display 600–700 caps, 3px border + 1.5px outline offset 2px, `--h-r-s`, rotate −6°…+8° (seeded by item id, never random per render) | `--pass` SAHI·APPROVED ✓, `--fail` GALAT·OBJECTION ✕, `--wait` PENDING ⏳, `--noted` NOTED/ISSUED/CLEARED | `mix-blend-mode: multiply` (light) / `screen` (dark); ≥ 20px, ≥ 24px on manila |
| **`h-receipt`** | receipt surface, mono 14px, rows with dashed leaders, zig-zag bottom via `mask` (tooth `--h-perf`) | printing (rows reveal top-down), static | rows: RECEIPT # · XP / SOURCE (label + ↗) / STATUS (legal chip + as of) / OTHER SIDE / GOVT THEN (chip) |
| **`h-sheet`** | `--h-sheet` fill, 2px outline, red margin rule at 18px, body UI 16px | collapsed (duels: "Read the noting") / open | explanations, rules, the Corrections page |
| **`h-chip`** | 28px, `--h-r-s`, mono 12px caps | `--legal` (neutral, every status), `--source` (COURT, CAG, SANSAD, PIB, ECI, RBI, AGENCY, PRESS, FACT-CHECK), `--govt` (neutral), `--kind` | the legal chip always pairs with an `as of` date |
| **`h-meter`** | 12px track, 2px outline, pill; syahi fill; optional tick every 1/5 (levels in a band) | animates width `--h-dur-slow` | goal-gradient copy sits beside it: "180 XP to Prime-Time Loyalist" |
| **`h-tile`** (cartogram) | square ≥ 44px, `--h-r-s`, 2px outline, display 700 code | `sealed` (manila + red tape band on the bottom edge), `progress` (manila + syahi bar, fraction), `cleared` (syahi fill + ✓ glyph top-right), `selected` (focus-ring style double ring) | the legend repeats glyphs; a list view with the same data is always one tap away |
| **`h-cert`** | receipt surface, 6px syahi hard shadow, typed header, label poster, THAPPA "ISSUED" stamp, Kalam note | preview / exporting | the export is always the light theme |
| **`h-top`** | 56px + safe-area top: wordmark हिसाब दो (display, `lang="hi"`, aria-label "Hisaab Do"), level chip, mute, settings | live question: replaced by the round header | — |
| **`h-nav`** | phone: bottom bar 64px + safe-area, five items (Home, Files, Duel, Receipts, Me) with lucide icons + labels; ≥ 900: left rail 88px | current = syahi text + 3px top/left bar | hidden in live rooms, pass-and-play and ceremonies |

## 6. Motion, sound and haptics (the whole vocabulary)

| # | name | when | motion | sound cue (`lib/fx/sound`) | haptic |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Press** (दबाओ) | any button, option, file, tile | translate(2px,2px) + shadow to 0, 90 ms; release 140 ms | `tap` | light |
| 2 | **Lock** | answer chosen | tab fills, ring appears, 90 ms (no bounce) | `select` | light |
| 3 | **Stamp** (ठप्पा) | verdict on a receipt, file cleared, certificate issued | scale 1.6→0.94→1, opacity 0→1, rotate to seed angle, 420 ms `--h-ease-stamp` | `stamp` (+ `correct` for pass / `wrong` for fail) | success / error |
| 4 | **Print** (छपाई) | receipt appears | rows reveal top-down, `clip-path` in 6 steps over 360 ms | `tick` ×1 | — |
| 5 | **Tape snap** | first card of a route | tape halves rotate ±12° and fall 24px, fade, 360 ms `--h-ease-tape` | `whoosh` (short) | light |
| 6 | **File slide** | screen/card enter | translateY(12px × travel) + fade, 220 ms ease-out; exit fade 140 ms | — | — |
| 7 | **Count** | XP, score, receipts totals | NumberCounter over 700 ms, tabular digits | `xp` once at the end | — |
| 8 | **Fill** | meters, goal gradient | width over 360 ms ease-out | — | — |
| 9 | **Swipe** | the poster word highlight | marker `background-size` 0→100%, 360 ms, once per visit | — | — |
| 10 | **Paper chits** | ceremonies only | `confetti` preset recoloured to manila, syahi, tape, paper; 1.2 s | `levelUp` (label) / `stamp` (file) | heavy |

Not used: shake on wrong (the OBJECTION stamp is kinder), hit-stop, parallax, idle loops, tickers.
**Reduced motion** (OS or Effects = Reduced): `--h-travel: 0`, fades only, stamps simply appear, 3D shows one
settled frame. **Effects = Off**: no confetti, particles or WebGL (2D art instead).
**Sound:** silent until the first tap (charter §7), then on at engine trim; mute always in the top bar; cues
≤ 1.2 s, ≤ 3 within 100 ms, each with a visual twin. Later, optional procedural cues: `print`, `snip`,
`clink`, `clank`, `ding` — v1 maps to existing cues.

---

## 7. Accessibility

- **Contrast** per §3.4. **Targets** ≥ 44×44 (answers 60px, cartogram tiles ≥ 44px: 7 columns with a 4px
  gap at 390px, 3px at 360px). Inputs ≥ 16px.
- **Focus:** `box-shadow: var(--h-focus-ring)` (a 2px ground gap, then a 3px syahi ring), visible on every
  interactive element, including files and tiles. Never `outline: none` without it.
- **Twins:** shape + letter + tint on options; icon + word (+ hatching) on verdicts; glyph on tiles; words on stamps.
- **Live regions:** round verdict and score change `aria-live="polite"` ("Correct. Comptroller and Auditor
  General. You lead 2–1."); the timer announces only at 5 s and 2 s (`polite`), never every second;
  lobby peer state changes are polite; toasts are `role="status"`.
- **Screen reader names:** "Option A, triangle: Election Commission of India". Cartogram tiles: "Uttar
  Pradesh, 3 of 6 answered". The cartogram has an equivalent **list view** (alphabetical, searchable).
- **Dialogs:** sheets and ceremonies trap focus, restore it on close, and close with Esc.
- **3D:** every scene box is `role="img"` with a label stating the real numbers ("Tijori: 214 receipts");
  the 2D fallback carries the same label.
- **Text zoom** to 200% without loss: no fixed heights on text containers; buttons wrap.
- **Language:** `<html lang>` follows the locale; Devanagari spans in English get `lang="hi"`.

## 8. Psychology and growth model

### 8.1 The core loop (Hooked, adjusted to be honest)

| stage | HISAAB DO | mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger (external) | a forwarded receipt card, a daily grid, or a duel link on WhatsApp | social proof from a friend, not from us |
| Trigger (internal) | "Is that forward true?" and "Where did the money go?" | curiosity + civic itch |
| Action (≤ 2 taps) | open link → the question is already on screen (no account, no name) | minimal friction (N14) |
| Variable reward | the **receipt** (what the source actually says), the stamp, the physics set piece settling differently, Surprise Audit | curiosity gap closed **with evidence**; variability without money |
| Investment | the receipt is filed in your Vault, a coin drops in your tijori, a file gets closer to cleared, the next label comes nearer | endowment + goal gradient |

### 8.2 Identity ladder (the long loop)
- **Labels are identity, not points** — the joke *is* the progress model: you earn your way from being
  labelled to asking questions. Band = floor(level / 5) from `levelForXp` (source of truth).
- **Goal gradient:** a band meter with five level ticks; copy tightens near the top: "2 levels to Receipt
  Maango" → "180 XP to Receipt Maango" → "One good file away."
- **Endowed progress:** the first card cuts the tape ("Tape cut. 1 of 6."); the first receipt drops the
  first coin; the first quest counts the first answer.
- **SDT:** *competence* — calibrated calls (Shayad / Lagta hai / Pakka) with visible points and a
  calibration line at the finish; *autonomy* — every file open from day one, name optional, no forced
  order; *relatedness* — friend duels, pass-and-play, share cards, one daily set for everyone.

### 8.3 Loss framing, honestly
- The only stakes are real facts: ₹ figures in stems come from the source; we never invent a loss ("you
  lost ₹500"). XP and labels are all you earn.
- Loss aversion is used once — the streak — cushioned by **CL (casual leave)**: 1 per 7 days, max 2,
  auto-applied; after a miss the copy only reassures.
- Tijori coins are **not a currency** ("1 coin = 1 sourced receipt. Not money."). JHK gems, Locker and
  stakes are **not surfaced** in this edition — no second currency (N10).

### 8.4 The share loop (WhatsApp-first, server-free)

| artefact | format | content | link target |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Receipt card** | PNG 1080×1350 (4:5) via canvas + Web Share Level 2 (files); fallback download + copy text | question, the four options, **no answer** ("Challenge" variant) *or* answer + stamp + SOURCE + STATUS + as of ("Receipt" variant) | `…/hisaab/#q=<id>`: a one-card taster, no account |
| **Daily grid** | text | `HISAAB DO · Aaj Ka Hisaab · 25 Sep 2026` / `✅✅❌✅✅ 4/5` / `Label: RTI Warrior` / `Har sawaal ka source hai. Khud check karo: <url>` | `…/hisaab/#aaj` |
| **Certificate** | PNG 1080×1350, light theme always | §11.14 | `…/hisaab/` |
| **Duel invite** | text + `https://wa.me/?text=` + Web Share + copy | "Muqabla? Triple Threat on HISAAB DO. Room 7K2Q-9F: <link>" | P2P room link |

The share button says **"Forward this — it's actually sourced"** / *"Forward karo — iska source hai."*
Share honesty: an item with `status` shares its status line verbatim with `as of`; a share never states a
wrong option as fact; every image carries "Satire. Every question sourced."; the certificate name is the
player's display name (≤ 20 chars) — if it matches a person in the bank's `people` lists (normalised), it
prints **"Anonymous Janta"**, so nobody can "certify" a real politician.

**Referral loop:** receipt card → one-card taster → receipt → label reveal → "Duel the friend who sent
this" or "Open today's file". P2P invite links are the second loop (no account, no server).
**Honest metrics:** taster → first file, source-link opens per session, share → open, invites accepted,
D1/D7. **Not goals:** session length, notification opt-ins.

### 8.5 Dark patterns we refuse (N1–N14 are release gates)

| gate | what we will not do | the concrete HISAAB rule |
|---|---|---|
| N1 fabricated near-miss | fake "so close" | margin lines ("Round 3 went to 0.3 s") only from `result.reason`/`elapsedMs`; TARAZU settles to the true score |
| N2 fake countdown/scarcity | urgency theatre | no ticking "resets in" on Aaj Ka Hisaab (static "New file at 00:00 IST"); no limited-time labels |
| N3 streak repair for money/ads, alarmist nags | streak fear | CL shields are automatic; no streak push, no "your streak is dying" |
| N4 ads in rounds / before the receipt | — | no ads in this edition |
| N5 confirmshaming | "No thanks, I like being an Andhbhakt" | decline buttons read "Not now". Labels are **never** used to shame a choice |
| N6 silent devaluation / hidden rule changes | — | every XP number is on the Rules page; rule changes are logged in Corrections with a date |
| N7 hidden bot fills | — | Babu-Bot is labelled BOT everywhere, and its random behaviour is disclosed |
| N8 auto-queued next duel, overlay chains, nags | — | Rematch and Next are always taps; at most one toast per visit; ceremonies only in two kinds |
| N9 fake presence | "2,341 playing now" | no live counts in this edition; the P2P lobby shows only the real peer state |
| N10 hidden cost, bundles, second currency | — | no money, no currency; coins are a picture of receipts |
| N11 child-directed exhortation | — | tone is for adults and teens; no mascots urging play |
| N12 difficulty rigging, undisclosed mercy | — | bot and deal are fixed and disclosed; no loss-streak easing |
| N13 pre-selected opt-ins | — | nothing is pre-ticked; the name field is empty; no marketing consent exists |
| N14 forced account before play | — | play first, and a name only if you share a certificate or host a room |
| Vocabulary | "bet, wager, odds, jackpot, casino" | Pakka is a "confidence call", never a bet |

**Edition-specific refusals (political):** no party leaderboards ("most corrupt party"), no team colours
or "pick your side" onboarding, no outrage-ranked feeds, no "dunk on the other side" share copy, no
person-as-answer distractors (charter §2.4), no label applied to a real person, and no share card
that drops the status line.

## 9. Notification budget (charter §7, made concrete)

**Rule set** (it wraps `createOverlayBudget` from `components/fx/overlay-budget.ts`):
1. **Toasts:** ≤ **1 per screen visit** (route change or sheet open = new visit). Later requests merge into it
   (mergeKey `visit`) or go to Profile › Activity unshown — logged, not lost.
2. **Ceremonies:** only `label` (new band) and `file` (**first** completion of a state/sector/Kiska/Forward
   file); if both fire, **one** ceremony with two stamps. Every other kind (level, achievement, stamp,
   streak, rank) is **downgraded to in-place**.
3. **Quiet:** `setQuiet(true)` from countdown to `round.result` and during the pass-and-play hand-over.
4. **Inline, not toast:** confirmations ("Copied ✓" on the button), offline banners, errors.
5. **Never:** push (Push API never requested), e-mail, icon badges, "come back" prompts, streak-risk
   warnings, sound before the first tap.
6. **Settings › Quiet everything:** sound, haptics, Effects and toasts off (toasts go to Activity).

| screen | ceremony may | the one toast (if any) | quiet in-place updates | must be silent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| First run | — | — | label reveal card (inline) | sound until tap |
| Home | label (only if a promotion was earned elsewhere and not yet shown) | CL used ("Missed a day. 1 CL used. Streak safe.") **or** quests-completed summary, not both | streak counter, quest ticks, tijori count, meter | "come back", streak risk |
| Files hubs / cartogram | — | — | tile states, best scores | — |
| Route card (untimed) | — | — | tape snap, stamp, receipt, XP on receipt | toasts (held for the finish) |
| Route finish | `file` (first clear) and/or `label` (merged) | quests completed (merged) | score, best improved, meters | level-ups inside a band |
| Aaj Ka Hisaab finish | `label` only | quests completed | grid, streak +1 | "tomorrow" countdown |
| Duel setup, P2P lobby | — | — | peer status, rank strip | presence counts |
| LIVE question | **none** | **none** | timer, lock state | everything else, including sound except tap/select |
| Round receipt | — | — | stamp, XP breakdown, combo, Surprise Audit | toasts |
| Match result | `label` | quests completed | XP count, Babu-rank delta, TARAZU | rank promotion ceremony (in place: "Promoted to Under Secretary") |
| Profile / Vault / Settings / Rules | — | — (Vault: "5 receipts due for re-check" is inline) | — | — |

## 10. 3D physics set pieces (R3F + @react-three/rapier)

**Common rules**
- Client-only lazy chunks (`React.lazy` in the Vite edition), never on first paint. `SceneFrame` gives dpr
  `[1, 1.5]`, the WebGL probe, context-loss fallback and offscreen pause. Rapier `timeStep 1/60`,
  `paused={!active}`, `frameloop="demand"` once all bodies sleep. One canvas at a time; unmount out of view.
- Low-poly, procedural materials, no network textures (decals from canvas textures).
- Load only when Effects = Full, no `saveData`, and `deviceMemory ≥ 4` where reported; otherwise 2D art.
- **Reduced motion:** step the world to rest off-screen (≤ 180 steps, < 30 ms), render **one** frame, `frameloop="never"`.
- **Hard rule:** the scene host reads the overlay-budget quiet flag and **refuses to mount** (and unmounts)
  from countdown until `round.result`. The only WebGL inside a room is TARAZU on the final result, and it
  unmounts before a rematch countdown.
- Physics decorates a **true number**: each scene's final state comes from real data, printed beside it.

| | **TIJORI** (safe) | **TARAZU** (balance scale) | **THAPPA** (rubber stamp) | **FILE PILE** (फ़ाइलों का ढेर) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Where | Home "Your tijori" panel (tap to open) and the Receipts Vault header | Match result (bot, friend, pass-and-play) | Aaj Ka Hisaab finish, the label-promotion ceremony, certificate issue | Route finish for state, sector, Kiska Media? and Forward Court files |
| Trigger | panel opened, or scrolled into view on capable devices after `requestIdleCallback` | 250 ms after the verdict text renders (text first) | the ceremony card is on screen | the finish screen renders |
| What happens | ₹ coins (1 per receipt collected) and note bundles (1 per 10) drop into a glass-front steel safe; only **new** receipts since the last open are animated (≤ 12), the rest start settled | one file-block weight drops into a player's pan per round won; the beam (revolute joint) tips; the final angle is **clamped to the true score** (diff × 6°, max 24°), a draw settles level | a wooden-handled stamp drops onto the receipt/certificate plane, bounces (restitution 0.3), leaves an ink decal on first contact, lifts away | six file covers drop 120 ms apart onto a desk, each with an APPROVED-green or OBJECTION-red edge by true result; a red-tape strap slides down and ties the pile; THAPPA stamps FILE CLEARED · 18/24 |
| Bodies | ≤ 60 dynamic coins (`InstancedRigidBodies`, cylinder colliders) + ≤ 12 bundles (cuboid); older bodies are merged into a static instanced "settled" stack; 5 static walls | 1 beam + ≤ 10 weights (Gauntlet 5 + 5), fulcrum static | 1 dynamic (compound: handle cylinder + base cuboid) + 1 static plane | 6 dynamic cuboids + 1 kinematic strap + THAPPA (1 dynamic) + desk |
| Budget | ≤ 12 draw calls, ≤ 60k tris, ≤ 6 ms JS/frame on a Snapdragon 6-series-class phone, canvas 280px (phone) / 360px (desktop) | ≤ 8 draw calls, settle ≤ 2.5 s then freeze, canvas 240 / 320px | the canvas lives ≤ 1.4 s, then unmounts; the 2D stamp remains | ≤ 10 draw calls, total ≤ 2.2 s, then freeze; canvas 260 / 340px |
| Fallback art (2D) | CSS glass box with stacked coin bars (height ∝ count, log-scaled after 100) + count | SVG scale rotated by the true angle, pans labelled | CSS stamp slam (motion #3) | CSS stack of six tabs with coloured edges + tape band + stamp |
| Sound twin | `gem` ping per landing, throttled ≤ 6/s, ±3 semitone variance | `stamp` thump per weight (low), `win`/`loss`/`draw` on settle | `stamp` + (`correct` for ISSUED) | `tick` per file, `whoosh` for the strap, `stamp` |
| Haptic twin | light on the first landing only | medium on settle | heavy once | light per file (≤ 3), heavy on the stamp |
| Label (a11y) | "Tijori: 214 receipts. 1 coin = 1 sourced receipt. Not money." | "Scale tips to you: 2 rounds to 1." | "Stamped: ISSUED — Receipt Maango." | "File cleared: Uttar Pradesh, 18 of 24." |

Reference implementation: `components/three/gem-vault.tsx` (instanced Rapier bodies, parking, nudge,
reduced-motion path) — TIJORI is its sibling.

## 11. Screens

Format per screen: **Primary** (the one violet button) · **390** · **1440** · **States** · **Copy**. Shared
states: `h-skeleton` loading; empty = one line of satire + one action; error = "File missing. Babu is on
leave." + Retry; offline = solo modes keep working (the bank ships in the build: "No network. The files are
already on your phone."), P2P and sharing say they need a network. Checked at 360/390/414 and 1440
(rail + max 1200 content).

### 11.1 First run (no account, name optional)
- **Primary:** Open today's file. Text links: "Pick a state instead", "Have a duel code?".
- **390:** full-height poster — kicker `F.No. 00/IN/2026`; *हिसाब दो / SHOW US THE ACCOUNTS*; "Janta ka
  paisa. Janta ka sawaal."; three typed lines ("Every answer comes with a receipt." · "30 states, 13
  sectors, one daily file." · "Satire on labels. Facts from sources."); EN/हिं toggle; footer "No account.
  Stored on this device. Rules & sources".
- **1440:** poster on a halftone patch with static TIJORI art (7 cols) | action card (5 cols).
- **After the first receipt:** an inline label card (not a ceremony): "You start as **ANDHBHAKT** — Forwards
  first. Reads never. Everyone starts here — of anyone, for anything. Receipts get you out." + meter "4
  levels to WhatsApp University Fresher".
- **Copy:** "Account? Zaroorat nahi. Seedha sawaal."

### 11.2 Home
- **Primary:** Open today's file → once done, **Resume <file>**, else **Duel Babu-Bot**.
- **390, top to bottom:** label block (kicker "You are · Level 7", label 30px with Devanagari above,
  one-liner, meter "180 XP to Prime-Time Loyalist") → **Today's file** (`h-file` + tape + `--h-shadow-3`,
  "5 questions · same for everyone today"; done → "4/5 · Share grid") → Resume ("Uttar Pradesh · 3 of 6")
  → **Your tijori** (static art + count; Open loads 3D) → **Aaj ke 3 kaam** (quests, in-place ticks) → four
  small files (Rajya, Sector, Kiska Media?, Forward Court) → Muqabla strip.
- **1440 (12 cols):** poster + label (1–7) | today's file (8–12); tijori 3D (1–5) | four files 2×2 (6–12);
  quests (1–6) | resume + duel (7–12).
- **States:** empty tijori "Tijori khaali hai. First receipt goes here."; offline inline banner.
- **Copy:** "Aaj ka hisaab ready hai." · "Streak: 6 days · 1 CL in hand".

### 11.3 Files hub + Rajya Rounds (records-room cartogram)
- The **Files** tab opens on a segmented control **Rajya · Sector · Kiska Media? · Forward Court** (default Rajya).
- **Cartogram** (7 × 7; `IN` is a 4-wide drawer). Not a map; makes no boundary claim. All 30 + Centre open.

```
- **Primary:** Open file / Resume file (for the selected tile; default = last opened).
- **390:** *राज्य राउंड्स / RAJYA ROUNDS*, "Pick a state. 6 cards. Every answer has a receipt.", grid (~47px
  tiles), glyph legend, **file brief** card (`F.No. S/UP`, EN + Devanagari name, sectors covered, best
  score). "List view" toggle: alphabetical, searchable, same data.
- **1440:** 72px tiles with small names (left) | sticky brief panel (right); search above.
- **States:** fewer than 6 items → the real count ("4 cards"); skeleton tiles.
- **Copy:** "Kaunsa rajya? Sab ki file khuli hai." · sealed tile: "Sealed. Tape cut on first card."

### 11.4 Sector Files
- **Primary:** Open file (on the expanded file; the next unfinished one is pre-expanded).
- **390:** *सेक्टर फ़ाइलें / SECTOR FILES* — 13 stacked manila files (`F.No. X/WEL`, lucide icon, "6 cards",
  meter, tape if sealed); tap expands the brief inline. **1440:** 3-column cabinet + side brief.
- **Copy:** "Welfare & Subsidies: kisko mila, kitna mila." · empty: "Koi file clear nahi. Abhi tak."

### 11.5 Kiska Media?
- **Primary:** Open the press file.
- **390:** *किसका मीडिया? / KISKA MEDIA?* — "Who owns the news that told you?"; outlet names as **plain mono
  text chips** (no logos, masthead styles or brand colours). Cards add an **ownership chain** (`h-own`:
  Owner → Holding → Outlet, text boxes + arrows) in the noting; source chip `FILING` or `PRESS`.
  **1440:** chain renders horizontally beside the receipt.
- **Copy:** "Channel kiska, paisa kiska." · "Ownership facts across groups and parties."

### 11.6 Forward Court
- **Primary:** Court is in session.
- **390:** *फ़ॉरवर्ड अदालत / FORWARD COURT* — "Claims from every side. Rulings by fact-checkers." The claim
  sits in a **generic paper chat bubble** tagged "↪ Forwarded many times" (never WhatsApp green, ticks or
  chrome); receipt chip `FACT-CHECK` + the checker's name in text; the ruling reads in the receipt
  ("Fact-checkers: misleading"). **1440:** bubble left, options right.
- **Copy:** "Forward aaya? Pehle receipt." · empty: "No forwards left today. Rare."

### 11.7 Aaj Ka Hisaab + the route card (all untimed routes)
- **Primary:** Next card → on finish, **Share today's grid**.
- **390:** header `F.No. D/2026-09-25 · 2 of 5` + five-segment bar (× saves and exits). Card: kicker
  (sector · state · year) → stem → **confidence switch** (*Shayad* +2/0 · *Lagta hai* +3/−1 · *Pakka* +4/−3,
  default Shayad, numbers visible) → four `h-opt` → "No timer — take your time. First answer locks." After
  lock: stamp → receipt prints → noting → Next card; secondary **Open source ↗**, **Forward this — it's
  actually sourced**. **1440:** card (≤ 560) left | receipt + noting right.
- **Done:** ✅/❌ grid, score, streak +1, "New file at 00:00 IST" (static — no countdown).
- **Copy:** "Aaj ke 5 sawaal. Sabke liye same." · "Aaj ka hisaab ho gaya. Kal naya file."

### 11.8 Duel setup (Muqabla)
- **Primary** (sticky launch bar): Start vs Babu-Bot / Create room / Start pass & play.
- **390, one scroll:** Opponent radio cards — *Babu-Bot · BOT* ("Picks at random. Can't see the question."),
  *Friend* ("Peer-to-peer room code. No server."), *Pass & Play* ("Two players, one phone, untimed"); Format
  cards with real numbers — *Quick Draw* 1 q · 10 s, *Triple Threat* best of 3 · 7 s, *The Gauntlet* 5 q ·
  5 s; Topic chips (Mixed + 13 sectors); "Have a code? Join"; rank strip "Babu rank: Section Officer · on
  this device"; rule line "Faster correct answer wins; within 0.15 s is a tie." **1440:** three columns.
- **Copy:** "Muqabla karo. Babu-Bot bina padhe stamp lagata hai."

### 11.9 P2P lobby
- **Primary:** I'm ready (→ "Waiting for <friend>").
- **390:** room code in mono 48px (`7K2Q-9F`) + **WhatsApp** (wa.me), **Copy link**, **Share**; seats: You (name
  or "Anonymous Janta") and Friend ("Waiting…" / "Connecting directly…" / "Connected · peer-to-peer" /
  "Ready"); format + topic summary; both ready → typed 3·2·1 (Sometype 96px, no WebGL). **1440:** code
  card left | seats right.
- **States:** failed → "Couldn't connect directly — some networks block this." + buttons Pass & Play /
  Babu-Bot; leave → "Leave the room?" (Leave / Stay). No typing indicators, no presence beyond the real link.
- **Copy:** "Code bhejo, dost bulao." · "Direct connection. Hamare paas kuch nahi jaata."

### 11.10 LIVE question (quiet surface; JHK timing contract)
- **Primary:** none — the four answers are the only controls.
- **390:** header = format · "Round 2 of 3" + score pill `1–0` (aria "You 1, Babu-Bot 0"); stem top;
  answers in the thumb zone; **timer bar directly above the answers** (6px ink, continuous rAF,
  `transition: none`, never red or shaking); after a tap: "Locked · waiting for the clock / for <friend>".
  **1440:** centred 560px column, single column of answers, keys 1–4 / A–D.
- **Hard rules:** card `visibility:hidden` until the double-rAF reveal marker — no entrance animation,
  layout shift or work before it; fixed option order; no correctness styling before `round.result`; no
  WebGL, particles, halftone, tape, stamps, marker, toasts or nav; only press/lock feedback and
  `tap`/`select`; overlay budget quiet.
- **Pass & Play:** untimed; after P1 locks, a full-screen cover ("Hand the phone to Riya. Don't peek.")
  until P2 taps "I'm Riya — show the question".
- **States:** P2P drop → "Connection lost — waiting 10 s", then the engine settles (`player-not-connected`)
  and the result states that reason.

### 11.11 Round receipt
- **Primary:** Next round (= ready; shows the friend's ready state) / Next card. Secondary: Open source ↗.
- **390, ≤ 900 ms sequence:** option states → **stamp** (SAHI · APPROVED ✓ / GALAT · OBJECTION ✕ / PENDING ⏳
  "No answer") → round line only if true ("You were 0.4 s faster" / "Tie — within 0.15 s") → receipt
  prints: `RECEIPT #0215 · +32 XP` (base 20 · fast +15 · combo ×1.25 · Surprise Audit ×2 when applied),
  SOURCE (label ↗), STATUS (legal chip + "as of Sep 2026"), OTHER SIDE, GOVT THEN → noting (collapsed in
  duels: "Read the noting"). A *next-round* Surprise Audit is announced here, never on the question card.
  **1440:** answers left | receipt + noting right.
- **Copy:** "Receipt mil gayi." · "Galat. Par receipt toh le lo." · "File pending. Clock ne stamp laga diya."

### 11.12 Match result
- **Primary:** Rematch (a tap, never automatic; P2P needs the friend's ready). Secondary: All receipts,
  Share result ("Beat Babu-Bot 2–1 on HISAAB DO. Har sawaal sourced.").
- **390:** verdict word 48px **JEET / HAAR / BARABAR** + "You won 2–1" → **TARAZU** (240px or 2D) → true
  margin line (if any) → XP count-up with breakdown → Babu-rank delta in place ("+30 · Section Officer
  70/150") → quests touched → swipeable round receipts. **1440:** verdict + scale | XP, rank, receipts.
- **Ceremony:** a label promotion queues ≥ 1.2 s after the result renders.
- **Copy:** "Haar gaye. Receipts phir bhi aapke." · "Barabar. Babu bhi hairaan."

### 11.13 Route finish (state, sector, Kiska Media?, Forward Court)
- **Primary:** Next file (a suggestion — neighbouring tile or next sector; "Choose another" beside it).
- **390:** **FILE PILE** (260px) + THAPPA *FILE CLEARED · 18/24* (first clear → `file` ceremony wraps it;
  replays → in-place "Best: 14 → 18") → calibration ("Pakka calls: 2 of 3 landed. Shayad kept you safe on
  2.") → six mini receipts → XP → **Share this file** (receipt-card carousel). **1440:** scene | summary.
- **Copy:** "Uttar Pradesh ki file clear. Feeta khul gaya."

### 11.14 Profile (Me): label ladder + certificate
- **Primary:** Share certificate (current rung).
- **390:** **the ladder** is the hero — nine rows (Certified Anti-National on top), each with Devanagari +
  Latin label, one-liner, "Level 20+"; earned rungs carry ISSUED + date; the current rung expands with the
  band meter and certificate thumbnail; future rungs stay readable (knowing the joke is the pull). Then
  stats (receipts, states x/30, sectors y/13, streak + CL, Babu rank "on this device"), **Stamp Register**
  (silent achievements), **Activity** (in-place updates + merged toasts), optional name ("Name on
  certificates"). **1440:** ladder (5 cols) | certificate preview (7 cols).
- **Certificate** (1080×1350, light): header `CERTIFICATE OF LABELLING · F.No. L-4/2026-0214`; "This is to
  certify that **{name}** has, after **{n} sourced receipts**, been officially labelled"; label poster +
  one-liner; THAPPA "ISSUED · 25 SEP 2026"; Kalam "Noted. Pl. forward."; rung dots (n of 9); footer
  "Satire. Not a government document. Every question sourced. · occult-kranti.github.io/fact-duel/hisaab".
- **Copy:** "Aapka label, aapki receipts." · empty name → "Anonymous Janta".

### 11.15 Receipts Vault
- **Primary:** Re-check 5 due (when due > 0), else Open today's file.
- **390:** TIJORI header (static; tap for 3D) + count → filter chips (All · Collected · Pending re-check ·
  State · Sector · Source type) → list of receipt minis (short stem, mini stamp, source, legal chip + as
  of) → tap = sheet with full receipt, noting, Open source ↗, Forward this. **Dobara Jaanch** (JHK recall
  lab) runs due items as untimed cards. **1440:** filters | list | detail (master–detail).
- **States:** empty "No receipts yet. Every answer files one here."; a bank status update shows "Status
  updated Sep 2026" with the old line struck through beside the new one.

### 11.16 Settings (sheet on phone, panel on desktop)
- **Primary:** Done (everything applies instantly).
- **Controls:** Language (English / हिन्दी) · Theme (Office by day / File room at night / Match phone) · Sound
  + volume · Haptics · Effects (Full / Reduced / Off — "Off: no 3D, no confetti") · **Quiet everything** ·
  Name · Data ("Everything is stored on this device"; Export JSON; Delete my progress → confirm "Delete /
  Keep") · static line "We never send notifications." · links: Rules & Sources, Corrections, Report a problem.

### 11.17 Rules & Sources / Corrections (trust + legal)
- **Primary:** Report an error in a question (prefilled issue link or mail draft with the item id).
- **390:** long-read noting sheet with a TOC dropdown; **1440:** sticky TOC + 62ch column.
- **Sections:** (1) what this is — satire about labels, facts from sources; (2) how we source (charter
  order); (3) legal status words defined — alleged, FIR, arrested, chargesheeted, on bail, acquitted,
  convicted, case closed, petition dismissed — and **"Nobody named here is guilty unless convicted."**; (4)
  the other side's answer is part of every fact; (5) balance — the Centre since 2014 is NDA-led, state
  files cover whoever governed, `govt` distribution audited; (6) distractors never name real people; (7)
  game rules with real numbers — `XP` table, confidence points, Surprise Audit odds (~1 in 6 ×2, ~1 in 36
  ×3), streak + CL, Babu rank "on this device", 0.15 s tie, fixed order, Babu-Bot's randomness; (8)
  privacy — device-only, P2P shares name and answers with the peer only; (9) art policy; (10)
  **Corrections log** — date · item id · change · why · source.
- **Copy:** "Galti hui? Batao. Hum receipt ke saath sudhaarte hain."

## 12. Engineering hand-off notes

- **Class prefix `h-`**, one CSS file per screen/component, tokens only. No `!important`.
- **Edition aliases** (engine lane, rows in `editions/hisaab/aliases.mjs`): the bot display name "Babu-Bot · BOT" (the room engine hardcodes
  "Lucky Guess · BOT"); rank labels (Bronze→LDC, Silver→Section Officer, Gold→Under Secretary,
  Platinum→Joint Secretary, Diamond→Secretary); `LEVEL_TITLES` → the nine labels; confidence display names
  (Steady→Shayad, Bold→Lagta hai, Called→Pakka), keeping the engine's ids and points.
- **Overlay budget wrapper:** `toastsPerVisit: 1`, `ceremonyKinds: ['label', 'file']`, merge-or-log; quiet from
  countdown to `round.result`.
- **Progress feedback:** drive it from `progressionDiff(before, after)`, as JHK does, but map `level` (in-band) →
  in-place, `band` change → `label` ceremony, `achievement` → Stamp Register (silent), `rank` → in place.
- **Mobile gate:** run `scripts/mobile-gate.mjs` against the edition build at 360/390/414 × en/hi × both themes,
  and read the PNGs; add the edition's screens to the gate's matrix (Phase 3.4).
