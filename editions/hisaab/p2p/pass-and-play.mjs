/**
 * editions/hisaab/p2p/pass-and-play.mjs — two players, one phone, no clock.
 *
 * A pure reducer. Each round both seats answer the same question in turn, handing the phone over in
 * between; nothing is revealed until both have answered. The verdict is the engine's own
 * (`roundVerdict` in lib/server/room-engine.mjs) with speed taken out: the phone is passed by hand, so
 * both answers carry the same (zero) time and two correct answers are a shared round ('both-correct')
 * rather than a race. Formats are the engine's: Quick Draw 1 round, Triple Threat first to 2 of 3,
 * The Gauntlet 5 rounds; the match winner is decided by `matchDecided` / `matchWinner`, as in a room.
 *
 * Nothing here is written to a profile: two people share one device, so there is no one player to
 * award. A screen may still show the facts afterwards (`state.rounds[i].question`).
 *
 * Phases: 'pass' (hand the phone to `turn`; the question stays hidden) → 'answer' (that seat picks)
 * → back to 'pass' for the other seat → 'reveal' (both answers, the key and the round result) →
 * `next` → the next round's 'pass', or 'complete'.
