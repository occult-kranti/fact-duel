/**
 * editions/hisaab/aliases.mjs — the whole difference between the JHK build and this edition's build,
 * as one table. Each entry swaps a shared module (by its resolved file) for the edition's twin.
 *
 * vite.config.hisaab.ts turns it into a resolveId plugin keyed by ABSOLUTE path, so the swap catches
 * every import of the module however it is written — `@/lib/content.mjs`, `../content.mjs` inside
 * lib/, `./bank.mjs` inside lib/server/. editions/hisaab/node-aliases.mjs applies the same table as a
 * node module hook, so tests can load the edition's module graph (tests/hisaab-*.test.mjs).
 *
 * A twin may import the module it replaces (the profile-sync twin re-exports the pure half of the
 * original): imports FROM the twin are never redirected.
 *
 * Paths are repo-relative. Keep `why` short; docs/hisaab/ENGINE.md explains each entry.
