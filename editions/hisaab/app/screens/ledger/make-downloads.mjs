 * screens/ledger/make-downloads.mjs — regenerate the money ledger's downloads from the data:
 *
 *   editions/hisaab/public/downloads/hisaab-money-ledger.csv    (this script, via ./csv.mjs)
 *   editions/hisaab/public/downloads/hisaab-money-ledger.xlsx   (./make_xlsx.py, openpyxl)
 *
 * Usage (repo root):  node editions/hisaab/app/screens/ledger/make-downloads.mjs
 * Env:  PYTHON=python3            the interpreter that has openpyxl
 *       XLSX_RECALC=<recalc.py>   optional: a LibreOffice recalculation script, so the "By year" sheet's
 *                                 COUNTIFS formulas carry cached values for readers that do not compute
 *                                 (Excel, LibreOffice and Google Sheets compute them on open anyway)
 *
 * Run it whenever editions/hisaab/data/money-ledger.json changes: tests/hisaab-ledger.test.mjs fails
 * when the CSV no longer matches the data, and checks the XLSX's row count and README.
