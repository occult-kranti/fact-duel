/**
 * screens/ledger/csv.mjs — the money ledger as a flat table: the column list shared by the CSV and the
 * XLSX downloads (public/downloads/hisaab-money-ledger.{csv,xlsx}) and the test that keeps them current.
 *
 * Plain JavaScript (no TypeScript, no bundler aliases) so node runs it as it ships:
 *   node editions/hisaab/app/screens/ledger/make-downloads.mjs     regenerates both files
 *
 * One row per measure, every field the row holds, the source URL in its own column. Text is verbatim;
 * multi-valued fields are joined with "; ". Party is who governed then — a column, not a verdict.
 * RFC 4180 CSV: CRLF line ends, fields quoted when they hold a comma, quote or line break, and a UTF-8
 * BOM so spreadsheet apps read ₹ and dashes correctly. A value that a spreadsheet would run as a
 * formula (leading =, +, -, @, tab or CR) is prefixed with an apostrophe.
